# Iris Classification Pipeline & Streamlit App

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using the Iris dataset. The project includes:
- A training script that builds an automated ML pipeline (with preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving).
- A Streamlit web application for model inference.
- A batch file that reads a `.env` file to initialize your virtual environment.

## Project Structure

```

├── train_model.py     # Script to build, train, and save the ML pipeline
├── iris_pipeline.pkl  # Saved model pipeline (generated by train_model.py)
├── .env               # Environment variable file containing VENV path
├── init_venv.bat      # Batch file to initialize the virtual environment
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies

```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Windows OS** (for the provided batch file)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository and navigate into its directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create/Activate Virtual Environment

#### Option A: Using the Provided Batch File

1. Update the `.env` file (see next section) with the path to your virtual environment activation script.
2. Run the batch file to initialize your virtual environment:

   ```batch
   init_venv.bat
   ```

#### Option B: Manually Activating Your Virtual Environment

If you prefer to activate your virtual environment manually, run:

```batch
<path-to-your-virtual-environment>\Scripts\Activate
```

### 3. Configure the Environment Variable

Create a file named `.env` in the project root with the following content:

```dotenv
VENV=<path-to-your-virtual-environment>\Scripts\Activate
```

Make sure the path corresponds to your virtual environment’s activation script.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Train the Model

Run the training script to load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train a RandomForest classifier (within a pipeline), evaluate its performance, and save the pipeline to disk.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

After running the script, a file named `iris_pipeline.pkl` will be generated.

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

Launch the Streamlit app to interact with the model via a web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

In your web browser, you will be able to:
- Input iris feature values (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- Click the **Predict** button to view the predicted iris species

## Additional Notes

- **Automated Retraining:**  
  You may schedule the training script using tools like cron jobs, Windows Task Scheduler, or more advanced scheduling tools such as Airflow if needed.

- **Modularity:**  
  The training and inference stages are separated. You can update the model by re-running `train_model.py` without affecting the Streamlit interface.

- **Customization:**  
  Feel free to extend the pipeline (e.g., add more preprocessing steps) or enhance the Streamlit app (e.g., add logging, error handling, or additional visualizations).
